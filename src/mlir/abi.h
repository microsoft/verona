/**
 * Language ABI and Lowering rules.
 *
 * This is a temporary handler for holding on to ABI specific ideas like how
 * to lower an iterator or a lambda or constants. Due to the current nature
 * of the AST, we need those ideas here. If we improve the AST, or create an
 * improved veneer of ABI related lowering, we should move this logic there
 * and remove these handlers.
 *
 * FIXME: For now, we're using strings to determine the types, but we'll need
 * to plug in a builder/context pair to create them correctly. If we keep the
 * names here in sync with the generator (unstable requirement), it can work for
 * now.
 *
 * The aim is to have objects that can generate structures, functions and other
 * objects in the right place (within the right lexical context, etc.), and
 * teach the generator to create those patterns on demand or to find the right
 * implementation (for ex. user-defined containers and functors).
