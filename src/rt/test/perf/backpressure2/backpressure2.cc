/**
 * This test involves many small sets of `Sender` cowns repeatedly selecting a
 * small random subset of `Receiver` cowns and sending them a message.
 *
 * A correct backpressure system should ensure that the receivers do not
 * experience runaway message queue growth with constantly changing
 * relationships between senders and receivers. All receivers must also maintain
 * high load signals despite constantly participating in multimessages with
 * different sets of cowns.
