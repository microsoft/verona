   * Single Produce Multiple Consumer Queue.
   *
   * This queue forms the primary scheduler queue for each thread to
   * schedule cowns.
   *
   * The queue has two ends.
   *
   *   - the back end can only be accessed from a single thread using
   *     `enqueue` to add elements to the queue in a FIFO way wrt to `dequeue`.
   *   - the front end can be used by multiple threads to `dequeue` elements
   *     and `enqueue_front` elements. `enqueue_front` behaves in a LIFO way wrt
   *     to `dequeue`.
   *
   * The queue uses an intrusive list in the elements of the queue.  (For
   * Verona this is the Cowns). To make this memory safe and ABA safe we use
   * to mechanisms.
   *
   *   - ABA protection from snmalloc - this will use LL/SC or Double-word
   *     compare and swap.  This ensures that the same element can be added
   *     to the queue multiple times without leading to ABA issues.
   *   - Memory safety, the underlying elements of the queue my also be
   *     deallocated however, if this occurs, then we could potentially access
   *     decommitted memory with the optimistic concurrency. To protect against
   *     this we use an epoch mechanism, that is, elements may only
   *     deallocated, if sufficient epochs have passed since it was last in
   *     the queue.
   *
   * Using two mechanisms means that we can have intrusive `next` fields,
   * which gives zero allocation scheduling, but don't have to wait for the
   * epoch to advance to reschedule.
   *
   * The queue also has a notion of a token. This is used to determine once
   * the queue has been flushed through.  The client can check if the value
   * popped is a token.  This is used to monitor how quickly this queue is
   * completed, and then can be used for
   *   - The leak detector algorithm
   *   - The fairness of scheduling
