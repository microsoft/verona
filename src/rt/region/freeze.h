   * Freezing an object graph
   * ========================
   *
   * The Freeze class provides the methods for freezing an isolated object
   * graph.
   *
   * In does two key things
   *  - calculates the union/find data structure for strongly connected
   *    components (SCC)
   *  - calculates the incoming references to an SCC. Pointers inside the SCC
   *    are not counted.
   *
   * Abstract Algorithm
   * ------------------
   *
   * We first explain the algorithm ignoring
   *
   *   - Not blowing up the stack, i.e. we give a recursive algorithm initially
   *   - nested isolated regions
   *   - pointers out of the isolated region into already immutable state or
   *     Cowns
   *   - optimisations to not use atomic reference counting while construction
   *
   * We use a union-find structure in the RegionMD field. The RegionMD field is
   * one of
   *
   *   - `UNMARKED`    - not yet visited
   *   - `SCC_PTR(p)`  - a pointer to another object that either directly or
   *                     indirectly knows its status
   *   - `RC(N)`       - A complete SCC with refcount N
   *   - `PENDING(N)`  - A incomplete SCC where the union-find structure has at
   *                   most depth N chains of SCC_PTR.
   *
   * In the abstract algorithm below, we define rep to find the root in the
   * union-find datastructure
   *
   * The core idea follows most path-based SCC algorithms. We use pending to
   * represent the current path. It is a stack of SCCs from the root to where we
   * are currently working. Foreach SCC on the current path, the entries are the
   * node highest in the spanning tree that DFS is walking. These entries are
   * not neccessarily the representatives in the union find structure. This is
   * important to allow the union-find structure to remain balanced.

   * Here is the abstract algorithm
   *
   * ```
   *   freeze (r) =
   *     pending = empty_stack
   *
   *     let rec freeze_inner(x) =
   *       match rep(x).status with
   *       | UNMARKED =>
   *         x.set_pending();
   *         pending.push(x);
   *         for each f in x
   *           freeze_inner(x.f)
   *         if (pending.peek() == x)         // (A) Post-order check
   *           x."makescc with ref count 1"()
   *
   *       | PENDING(N) =>
   *         while (rep(x) != rep(pending.peek()))
   *           union(x, pending.pop())
   *
   *       | RC(N) =>
   *           x.status = RC(N+1)
   *
   *     freeze_inner (r)
   *
   *     forall o : object
   *       if (o.status ==  UNMARKED)
   *          finalise o
   *
   *     forall o : object
   *       if (o.status ==  UNMARKED)
   *          deallocate o
   * ```
   *
   * While walking the DFS, if we encounter a `PENDING` node, then we can
   * collapse everything on the path to the back edge.  If we encounter a `RC`,
   * then we have found a reference into a complete SCC, and should up its
   * reference count.
   *
   * Implemenation
   * -------------
   *
   * In the runtime code, we use a dfs stack, rather than the actual call stack.
   * To achieve the postorder check (A), we use the bottom bit in the DFS entry
   * stack to represent that this is a postorder access.
   *
   * In the code we use:
   *
   *  * `UNMARKED` for a node we have not yet visited
   *  * `PENDING` represents the current path from the root to where we are
   *    working.  The value stored in pending represents the maximum depth of
   *    SCC chain.
   *  * `RC_NON_ATOMIC` represents a completed SCC root.
   *    The value stored represents the number of incoming edges found so far.
   *  * `SCC_PTR` represents something that has been found to be part of a
   *    cycle. If, via a series of zero or more `SCC_PTR`, this points to
   *    `PENDING` then this is part of an SCC that is still being calculated.
   *    If via a series of zero of more SCC_PTR this points to an
   *    `RC_NON_ATOMIC`, then this is part of a completed SCC.
   *  * `Object::RC` and `Object::COWN` refer to immutable objects outside the
   *    current isolate.
   *
   * The objects stack is used to keep track of the set of objects in the
   * region. Rather than copy the set up front, we lazily construct it using the
   * ring in the isolated regions. Every time we break the ring, we keep track
   * of that point in the objects stack.
