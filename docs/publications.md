## Concurrency

The concurrency model develop by Project Verona is called Behaviour-Oriented Concurrency. It is described in the following paper:

It has been applied to build deterministic parallel execution in the following paper:
- [DORADD: Deterministic Parallel Execution in the Era of Microsecond-Scale Computing](https://doi.org/10.1145/3710848.3710872)

# snmalloc
snmalloc is a memory allocator that is used in Project Verona. You can read more about it in the following papers:

- [BatchIt: Optimizing Message-Passing Allocators for Producer-Consumer Workloads: An Intellectual Abstract](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/batchit-optimizing-message-passing-allocators-for-producer-consumer-workloads-an-intellectual-abstract/)
  Nathaniel Filardo, Matthew J. Parkinson, ISMM 2024.
- [snmalloc: A message passing Allocator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/issm-2019-proceedings-of-the-2019-acm-sigplan-international-symposium-on-memory-management/)
  David Chisnall, Sylvan Clebsch, Sophia Drossopoulou, Juliana Vicente Franco, Paul Lietar, Matthew J. Parkinson, Alex Shamis and Christoph  M. Wintersteiger, ISMM 2019.

It is available on [Github](https://github.com/microsoft/snmalloc) and is used in many other projects, and has an active usage in the Rust community [snmalloc-rs](https://crates.io/crates/snmalloc-rs).
