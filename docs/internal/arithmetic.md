# Arithmetic

Numeric types in Verona are nothing but classes with methods that implement known arithmetic functions.

For example:
```
  let x : I8 & imm = 42;
  let y : I8 & imm = 24;

  // This is what a programmer would write
  let sum = x + y; // type inference to I8

  // This is what it would turn to
  let sum = x.+(y);
  // Or this
  let sum = I8::+(x, y);
```

Operations in Verona are nothing but function calls with numeric types.
If an operation refers to a function that is not implemented, this is a syntax error.

For example:
```
  let x : I8 & imm = 42;
  let y : I16 & imm = 24;

  // There is no such function I8::+(I8, I16);
  let sum = x + y; // ERROR

  // We can extend x, then add
  let z : I16 & imm = x.toI16();
  let sum = z + y; // type inference to I16

  // This is what it would turn to
  let sum = z.+(y);
  // Or this
  let sum = I16::+(z, y);
```

Verona does not have type casts, auto-promotion or guessing the types of arguments to functions.

The implementation of `x + y` to `x.+(w)` isn't really a conversion, but a syntactic feature of the language.
Prefix and infix operations are handled in the same way, so `a foo b` is the same as `a.foo(b)` and `ATy::foo(a, b)`.

## Type-boxing

To represent dynamic types, we'll use type boxing, which uses the fact that IEEE-754 64-bit floating point numbers have 53 bits left for NaN encodings (aka. NaN-boxing).
With around 48 bits used to represent pointers, and any integer up to 32-bits fitting that space, too, we can use the left-over bits to tag which type the 64-bit pattern represents.
Obviously, 64-bit integers cannot be represented in that manner, so it will need a longer representation (tag+payload) on different words.

The implementation details are still under discussion, which will determine what type of boxing we want and which bits we'll use for what.
